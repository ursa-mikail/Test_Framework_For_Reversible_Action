# Test Framework For Reversible Action 

## Overview

The `Test Framework For Reversible Action` is a Python framework designed to test reversible actions, such as encryption and decryption functions. It allows to add pairs of actions and their corresponding reverse actions along with test cases, and then run these tests to verify that the actions are correctly reversible.

## Features

- Add tests for action and reverse action pairs.
- Run tests and validate the results.
- Supports testing of cryptographic functions, transformations, and other reversible operations.
